          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>The story of Cloud Giant Storage begins at the foot of a looming mountain, it’s top obscured by cloud cover  - a mountain dubbed the Cloud Storage Market. Discovering one’s originality and carving out a corner for one’s self in a market fraught with competitors of monstrous proportions proved the keys to conquering the treacherous twists and turns of the mountain ahead, but how did our young adventurer come about these keys and their secrets hidden within?</p>

          <h3>Why Tabletop Gamers?</h3>
          <p>Tabletop Gamers are a group of users who play Tabletop Roleplaying Games, such as Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder.</p>
          <p>There are existing Tabletop Gaming apps that serve a similar function to Cloud Storage apps. However, these are dedicated to a specific Tabletop RPG product, such as D&D Beyond which can be used for Dungeons and Dragons only.</p>
          <p>While Tabletop Gamers use many common features of Cloud Storage apps regularly as a part of gameplay, there is no Cloud Storage app that currently services Tabletop Gamers specifically. Particularly, the collaboration tools do no function the way Tabletop Gamers would prefer them to. An opportunity exists for an app specifically tailored to these users’ needs to break into the crowded market of Cloud Storage Apps.</p>

          <article class="survey-card">
            <p>The features the client requested the app to have were all features currently available on other cloud storage apps in the market, so I started my user research by conducting a survey focused on asking cloud storage app users about their current habits using these features. I found that:</p>

          <p>I performed a competitive analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box, the 3 biggest competitors in the Cloud Storage market. All three companies offered very similar or the same features, many of which were covered in the client’s desired features list. After anayzing each company, I determined that the best opportunity for a new competitor to break into the Cloud Storage Market would be to find a niche of users to brand their product towards whose needs weren’t being specifically met by one of the products in the market.</p>

          <h4>User Personas</h4>
          <p>Using the research I gathered from my User Surveys, I created User Personas. These Personas were types of users that would mainly need to upload large amounts of pictures, text files, and PDFs and share those files with their friends and family, as these had received the largest response from the User Survey.</p>

          <h4>User Stories & Flows</h4>
          <p>To complete creating a clear vision for the project, I next used the data from my survey to make User Stories and User Flows. These User Flows laid out what screens would be needed for the project and represent all of the high priority User Stories, which were uploading, organizing, and sharing content, and then collaborating on that content.</p>

        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <article class="target-audience">
          <h4>Target Audience</h4>
          <p>With the vision for the project now clear concerning which features it should include, it was time to focus on a target audience. I looked back at my User Personas I had created from data from my User Surveys and began sketching different brand ideas I thought would appeal to each Persona. The logo that stood out most was ‘Cloud Giant Storage’, a brand I had created to appeal to Tabletop Gamers. I am part of a group of Tabletop Gamers and am familiar with them and their needs, and I knew it was a unique direction I could take the project in that also provided me with a group of users I could test my product with. </p>

          <h4>Logo</h4>
          <p>To appeal to Tabletop Gamers, I centered the branding around a fun, social, collaborative feel. I expressed this through the mascot character who serves as the logo named ‘Blue’. Blue is a Cloud Giant, a race of giants from the popular game Dungeons and Dragons. I stylized his mouth to look like a file folder, expressing the idea that this is a Cloud Storage app.</p>

        <article class="color-scheme">
          <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
          <p>The main color for the brand is blue, associating the brand with sky and cloud imagery while also providing the user with a calming feeling, like they can relax knowing their files are safe on the service. I chose a bright blue color to be the brand color, implementing it when the user’s attention needs to be drawn to something on the app, such as an interactable element.</p>

        <h3>User Experience Design</h3>
        <article class="design-text">
          <h4>Sketches & Wireframes</h4>
          <p>My goal now was to bring the Brand and the Vision to life in the form of a product. I began by translating my User Flows into paper sketches and wireframes of the Dashboard, File, and Onboarding Pages. These wireframes were then made into an Invision prototype that could be tested with users.</p>

          <h4>High Fidelity Mockups</h4>
          <p>Using feedback from testing the wireframe prototype, the first round of high fidelity mockups were created. Elements from these mockups then received preference testing with a group of Tabletop Gaming users. Using the data collected from the usability testing and preference testing, the hi-fi mockups below were refined and a new prototype, high fidelity was created.</p>

          <p>The new prototype recevied a fresh round of Usability Testing where all high priority User Stories were tested again. The designs were then finalized and updated to create the final Clickable Prototype, which you can click through for yourself below.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Through User Research and Testing, I was able to arrive at a solution that fulfilled the client’s and the users’ needs. Users are easily able to upload, share, and collaborate on content, and is geared towards and audience that will make good use of these features without being prohibitive to use for a general user.</p>
          <p>I learned with this project the importance of User Research and how it can inform multiple aspects of a project, not just in the development of features, but also in the branding and design for the project. I also learned the benefits of testing my designs early and often, especially if it is possible to test with the target audience for the project.</p>
