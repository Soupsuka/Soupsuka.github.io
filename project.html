            <p>...begins at the foot of a looming mountain, it’s top obscured by cloud cover  - a mountain dubbed the Cloud Storage Market. Discovering one’s originality and carving out a corner for one’s self in a market fraught with competitors of monstrous proportions proved the keys to conquering the treacherous twists and turns of the mountain ahead, but how did our young adventurer come about these keys and their secrets hidden within?</p>

            <h2>Why Tabletop Gamers?</h2>
            <p>Tabletop Gamers are a group of users who play Tabletop Roleplaying Games, such as Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder.</p>
            <p>There are existing Tabletop Gaming apps that serve a similar function to Cloud Storage apps. However, these are dedicated to a specific Tabletop RPG product, such as D&D Beyond which can be used for Dungeons and Dragons only.</p>
            <p>While Tabletop Gamers use many common features of Cloud Storage apps regularly as a part of gameplay, there is no Cloud Storage app that currently services Tabletop Gamers specifically. Particularly, the collaboration tools do no function the way Tabletop Gamers would prefer them to. An opportunity exists for an app specifically tailored to these users’ needs to break into the crowded market of Cloud Storage Apps.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <h5>The process of creating Cloud Giant Storage began with User Research. This User Research included conducting a Survey, doing a Competitive Analysis, creating User Personas, and making User Stories and User Flows.</h5>
          </article>
          <article class="white-box">
            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>The features the client requested the app to have were all features currently available on other cloud storage apps in the market, so I started my user research by conducting a survey focused on asking cloud storage app users about their current habits using these features. I found that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>40%</p></li>
                <li><p>45%</p></li>
                <li><p>55%</p></li>
                <li><p>80%</p></li>
                <li><p>80%</p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><p>of users said they use Cloud Storage apps for saving web content</p></li>
                <li><p>of users said they liked their Cloud Storage app’s organization tools</p></li>
                <li><p>of users said they liked creating files on their Cloud Storage app</p></li>
                <li><p>of users said they liked sharing files on their Cloud Storage app</p></li>
                <li><p>of users said they used Cloud Storage apps for saving Pictures, Files, and PDFs from their devices</p></li>
            </ul>
          </article>
          <article class="grey-box">
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <ul class="storage-logos">
              <li><img src="/images/drive logo.png" alt="drive-logo"></li>
              <li><img src="/images/dropbox logo.png" alt="dropbox-logo"></li>
              <li><img src="/images/box logo.png" alt="box-logo"></li>
            </ul>
            <p>I performed a competitive analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box, the 3 biggest competitors in the Cloud Storage market. All three companies offered very similar or the same features, many of which were covered in the client’s desired features list. After anayzing each company, I determined that the best opportunity for a new competitor to break into the Cloud Storage Market would be to find a niche of users to brand their product towards whose needs weren’t being specifically met by one of the products in the market.</p>

            <h3>User Personas</h3>
            <p>My survey had provided me with some ideas of the types of users and the features they used when using a Cloud Storage app, but I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of these users in order to find my target audience and how they would be interacting with the app.</p>

            <h4>The Controller</h4>
            <h5>Age: 29 | Location: Boston | Job: Designer | Gender: Male</h5>
            <h5>Motivations</h5>
            <p>Blaine likes his world to be in order. He needs to know where his files are and that they’re in the state he left them in. At work, Blaine has to use the company cloud storage to back-up his files. He likes the control his managers and leads have over the content that is stored and shared on that cloud storage, and he wishes he could have something like that for his personal use without paying a monthly subscription for it. In his free time, Blaine is a Game Master for the many tabletop role playing games he and his friends play, and he finds himself saving, editing, and sharing a lot of pictures, text files, and PDFs. He doesn’t like how, especially PDFs, don’t always save correctly and are difficult to edit using in-app tools due to their limited features. As he is saving a lot of similar files, he also wants easy organization tools so he can find things quickly.</p>
            <h5>Frustrations</h5>
            <li><p>Doesn’t like in-app creation tools</p></li>
            <li><p>Doesn’t trust auto-save</p></li>
            <li><p>Wants to see a version history</p></li>

            <h5>Age: 38 | Location: Chicago | Job: Accountant | Gender: Female</h5>
            <h5>Motivations</h5>
            <p>Rose has a big family and an even bigger social life, and she likes sharing every moment with all of her friends, family, and coworkers.  Rose wants to use an app that is easily compatible with her and her circle’s devices, so everyone can see what she’s doing. What she’d like to use her cloud storage as is a giant scrapbook where she knows all of her pictures and files are safe, she can share them with other people, and they can either add to it or comment on it. The more the merrier as far as she’s concerned, so she’d love to be able to share her content by large email chain or by texting someone a link.</p>
            <h5>Frustrations</h5>
            <li><p>Lack of storage space</p></li>
            <li><p>Compatibility issues with devices or other apps</p></li>
            <li><p>Large storage plans are expensive</p></li>

            <h3>User Stories & Flows</h3>
            <p>To complete creating a clear vision for the project, I next turned these user stories into User Flows. These User Flows completed the vision for the project and laid out what screens I would need to design to bring these features to life.</p>

          <article class="grey-box">
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>With the vision for the project now clear concerning which features it should include, it was time to focus on a target audience. I looked back at my User Personas I had created from data from my User Surveys and began sketching different brand ideas I thought would appeal to each Persona. The logo that stood out most was ‘Cloud Giant Storage’, a brand I had created to appeal to Tabletop Gamers. I am part of a group of Tabletop Gamers and am familiar with them and their needs, and I knew it was a unique direction I could take the project in that also provided me with a group of users I could test my product with.</p>

            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>To appeal to Tabletop Gamers, I centered the branding around a fun, social, collaborative feel. I expressed this through the mascot character who serves as the logo named ‘Blue’. Blue is a Cloud Giant, a race of giants from the popular game Dungeons and Dragons. I stylized his mouth to look like a file folder, expressing the idea that this is a Cloud Storage app.</p>

          <article class="grey-box">
            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
            <p>The main color for the brand is blue, associating the brand with sky and cloud imagery while also providing the user with a calming feeling, like they can relax knowing their files are safe on the service. I chose a bright blue color to be the brand color, implementing it when the user’s attention needs to be drawn to something on the app, such as an interactable element.</p>

Using the data collected from the usability testing and preference testing, the hi-fi mockups below were refined and a new prototype, high fidelity was created.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Through User Research and Testing, I was able to arrive at a solution that fulfilled the client’s and the users’ needs. Users are easily able to upload, share, and collaborate on content, and is geared towards and audience that will make good use of these features without being prohibitive to use for a general user.</p>
            <p>I learned with this project the importance of User Research and how it can inform multiple aspects of a project, not just in the development of features, but also in the branding and design for the project. I also learned the benefits of testing my designs early and often, especially if it is possible to test with the target audience for the project.</p>
