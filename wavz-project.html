            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>The features the client requested the app to have were all features currently available on other cloud storage apps in the market, so I started my user research by conducting a survey focused on asking cloud storage app users about their current habits using these features. I found that:</p>

            <p>I performed a competitive analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box, the 3 biggest competitors in the Cloud Storage market. All three companies offered very similar or the same features, many of which were covered in the client’s desired features list. After anayzing each company, I determined that the best opportunity for a new competitor to break into the Cloud Storage Market would be to find a niche of users to brand their product towards whose needs weren’t being specifically met by one of the products in the market.</p>

            <p>My survey had provided me with some ideas of the types of users and the features they used when using a Cloud Storage app, but I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of these users in order to find my target audience and how they would be interacting with the app.</p>

            <span class="personas-info"><h4>Age: 29 | Location: Boston | Job: Designer | Gender: Male</h4></span>
            <h4>Motivations</h4>
            <p>Blaine likes his world to be in order. He needs to know where his files are and that they’re in the state he left them in. At work, Blaine has to use the company cloud storage to back-up his files. He likes the control his managers and leads have over the content that is stored and shared on that cloud storage, and he wishes he could have something like that for his personal use without paying a monthly subscription for it. In his free time, Blaine is a Game Master for the many tabletop role playing games he and his friends play, and he finds himself saving, editing, and sharing a lot of pictures, text files, and PDFs. He doesn’t like how, especially PDFs, don’t always save correctly and are difficult to edit using in-app tools due to their limited features. As he is saving a lot of similar files, he also wants easy organization tools so he can find things quickly.</p>
            <h4>Frustrations</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Doesn’t like in-app creation tools</li>

            <p>Rose has a big family and an even bigger social life, and she likes sharing every moment with all of her friends, family, and coworkers.  Rose wants to use an app that is easily compatible with her and her circle’s devices, so everyone can see what she’s doing. What she’d like to use her cloud storage as is a giant scrapbook where she knows all of her pictures and files are safe, she can share them with other people, and they can either add to it or comment on it. The more the merrier as far as she’s concerned, so she’d love to be able to share her content by large email chain or by texting someone a link.</p>

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>With the vision for the project now clear concerning which features it should include, it was time to focus on a target audience. I looked back at my User Personas I had created from data from my User Surveys and began sketching different brand ideas I thought would appeal to each Persona. The logo that stood out most was ‘Cloud Giant Storage’, a brand I had created to appeal to Tabletop Gamers. I am part of a group of Tabletop Gamers and am familiar with them and their needs, and I knew it was a unique direction I could take the project in that also provided me with a group of users I could test my product with.</p>

            <p>To appeal to Tabletop Gamers, I centered the branding around a fun, social, collaborative feel. I expressed this through the mascot character who serves as the logo named ‘Blue’. Blue is a Cloud Giant, a race of giants from the popular game Dungeons and Dragons. I stylized his mouth to look like a file folder, expressing the idea that this is a Cloud Storage app.</p>

            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
            <p>The main color for the brand is blue, associating the brand with sky and cloud imagery while also providing the user with a calming feeling, like they can relax knowing their files are safe on the service. I chose a bright blue color to be the brand color, implementing it when the user’s attention needs to be drawn to something on the app, such as an interactable element.</p>

            <h2><span class=underline>Conclusion</span></h2>
            <p>Through User Research and Testing, I was able to arrive at a solution that fulfilled the client’s and the users’ needs. Users are easily able to upload, share, and collaborate on content, and is geared towards and audience that will make good use of these features without being prohibitive to use for a general user.</p>
            <p>I learned with this project the importance of User Research and how it can inform multiple aspects of a project, not just in the development of features, but also in the branding and design for the project. I also learned the benefits of testing my designs early and often, especially if it is possible to test with the target audience for the project.</p>
