          <h3>About Me:</h3>
          <h3>Cecily Cunningham</h3>
          <p>If communication is key, design is my first language.</p>
          <p>After graduating college, I was lucky enough to be given the chance to chase a dream I’d had my whole life: to live in Japan. However, upon moving there, I quickly discovered that my less-than-fluent Japanese skills made communication an issue I had to consider constantly. I thought about it everywhere, from the grocery store to the bus to my classroom where I taught English. Luckily for me, Japan is a country that uses the art of visual communication to ease understanding without having to say a word. Their use color, typography, and a clear visual hierarchy made it easier for me to communicate without having to read much or understand all of what was being said to me.</p>
          <p>I applied this use of visual language to my lessons and worksheets in my work as an English as a second language teacher there, creating a clear and consistent visual hierarchy, simplifying my English, and pairing instructions or vocabulary words with pictures. I researched typography that was easier to read for non-native readers, and learned to survey my students regularly to ensure my lessons were being effective as well as interesting. Not only was it more efficient for me to create worksheets and lessons now that I had a template and a language I could easily implement, but my students reacted well to the change in teaching strategy with increased productivity and comprehension. I achieved my goal of effectively communicating with my students so that lessons could be conducted in all English with very little needing to be translated into Japanese.</p>
          <p>After spending 3 years chasing my dreams in Japan I moved back to America and began looking towards my other dream in life: working in a creative field. I came upon UX design, and it was love at first sight. UX design marries my love of art and design with my natural curiosity and love of research. As I’ve navigated my UX journey, I’ve found myself thinking back not only to my artistic experience, but to the lessons about communication I learned in Japan. My experiences in Japan continue to inspire me to be a better designer, and taught me that design isn’t just a tool to make things look cool and interesting. Design can also be a type of language, whether the person you’re communicating with speaks your language or not. I want to use my design skills to help ease the use of websites and apps for people around the world, as well as make some stuff that looks pretty dang cool.</p>
